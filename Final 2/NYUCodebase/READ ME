Hi! 

This was a project I had for my intro to game programming class. In order to get this code up and running is a fairly difficult process.
There are a lot of different frameworks and parts that need to be in your directory, but running it in xcode should work immediately.
This game was modeled off of "Galaga," actual code to be seen is in main.cpp.
